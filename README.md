# Homework 01 - Code Refactor

## Description

For this webpage, I was given an existing HTML codebase and updated to use semantic HTML elements along with cleaning up the CSS to be more concise and organized.

## Installation

## Usage

The webpage, as shown below, was originally written using "div" HTML elements and was rewritten using semantic HTML elements so the site will load in the same manner to how it was originally coded. Additionally, the CSS elements were organized to minimize used space and also provide a clear order when read.
